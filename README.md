### Hi, I'm Basil ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to my GitHub Profile 

I am a Lead Data Scientist, Professor, and Python lover who loves all things related to Data Science. I have built many ML models, visualizations, and scripts to automate the data clean up. I love doing data science and am striving to build and nurture quality online relationships, so if you've made it this far, don't hesistate to reach out. 

### Technical Skills
I program mainly in Python. For data analysis, I use the Pandas and Numpy libraries. For Machine Learning, I use Statsmodels and Scikit learn. I've built many types of apps in Python. With data science, it always comes to getting good data, cleaning that data, and then building something useful on top of it. 

In addition, I am skilled in SQL and NoSQL databases though I use those less on GitHub.
